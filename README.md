# ydl-project
Using the embedded version of youtube-dl you'll be able to search or copy/paste a link into the command line (will make GUI soon) and download the file to the directory of choice.
This is a simple project. I'm throwing it up on here so I can share with people who are better than me so they can critique my work and make me do better. If you're looking at this, thanks.

As of 2/28/18 the way this little turd works on the command line is:

You will be prompted to search for a song or to input a link to a song. Then you will be prompted on where to download this song to. If you just hit enter afterwards the song should download to your current working directory.
