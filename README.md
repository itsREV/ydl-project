# ydl-project
Using the embedded version of youtube-dl you'll be able to search or copy/paste a link into the command line (will make GUI soon) and download the file to the directory of choice.
This is a simple project. I'm throwing it up on here so I can share with people who are better than me so they can critique my work and make me do better. If you're looking at this, thanks.

As of 2/28/18 the way this little turd works on the command line is:

It will ask you to enter a URL (you can also just search for a song like you would on youtube).
Then it will ask where you want to download it too (this is broke atm, hope to fix soon). After that it will download the selected link or search and convert it using ffmpeg to mp3 and store into your directory of choice.
